Sauce for Zwift™
===========
![Sauce](pages/images/logo_horiz_320x120.png)
#### A collection of add-ons and replacement widgets for Zwift
Sauce for Zwift™ extends the zwift cycling and running simulator with more stats and
pretty things.


Requirements:
--------
As of July 2022 Sauce is a full encrypted game client that "watches" your normal
Zwift account like a 2nd instance of Zwift itself.  As such, you'll need to create
a second login (free is fine).  Although a bit annoying this does allow you to
run S4Z on any device, anywhere.
